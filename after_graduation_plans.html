    <h2>My Plans After Graduation</h2>

    <p>
        After graduation I plan to head to Missouri Western to major in Computer Science and a minor in Cyber Security while living with my father. I plan to get some kind of
        computer related job while there in college to have some sort of income based off all the certifications I will get here in Four County and my knowledge gained from college.
        <!-- Might add some images of Missouri Western and St. Joseph -->
