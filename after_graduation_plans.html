        <p>
            After graduation I plan to head to Missouri Western to major in Computer Science and a minor in Cyber Security while living with my father. I plan to get some kind of
            computer related job while there in college to have some sort of income based off all the certifications I will get here in Four County and my knowledge gained from college.
