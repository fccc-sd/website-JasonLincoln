    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        Hello, I am currently attending
        Four County Career Center as a Senior in the Computer 
        Programming Lab. Some of my interests include gaming, 
        reading, working out with Calisthenics and extracurriculars
        such as Archery and Marching Band. If im not at home playing games or reading im usually out with my friends watching a new movie that just came out that peaked our interest.
        <br>
        The games that I enjoy playing the most are single player/multiplayer exploration games.
        These games include Assassin's Creed, Borderlands, Diablo, Final Fantasy, and Minecraft. Most Tv shows and movies that I watch are Marvel or DC oriented. However I do like to
        watch other movies that peak my interests. The books I like reading are mostly fantasy. For example, these include the Harry Potter series,
        Fablehaven series, and the Mortal Instruments series.
