    <h2>
        Video Games
    </h2>

    <p>
        
        As you probably read from my intro page I like the game series Assassin's Creed, Final Fantasy, Diablo, Borderlands and the game Minecraft. With each of these franchises there aren't many of the games
        among them that I dislike. However, my least favorites would probably consist of Mirage from the Assassin's Creed franchise, The original Borderlands, Diablo 2 from the Diablo franchise,
        and Final Fantasy 2 from the Final Fantasy Franchise. However there are many other games that I enjoy playing such as

        <ul>
            <li>Clair Obsur: Expedition 33</li>
            <li>Lies of P</li>
            <li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li>
            <li>Risk of Rain 2</li>
            <li>Deadzone Rogue</li>
            <li>Stardew Valley</li>
            <li>Supermarket Simulator</li>
            <li>Bloons TD 6</li>
        </ul>

        Those are just my favorites of the other games that I play.
        I mostly play games on my PS5, Laptop or mobile games like Mobile Legends, Clash of Clans, and Clash Royale.

        <h2> Magic The Gathering</h2>
    <p>
        I also enjoy playing Magic The Gathering(specifically Commander). Im in the process of building a Kellan the Kid and Ezio Auditore deck. I originally got into Magic 3 years ago 
        thanks to my dad and have had to play standard on MTG Arena for 2 years, eventhough I love the thrill of playing Commander and especially building the decks and seeing them 
        work and do what I want them to do. The decks that I currently own are 

        <ul>
            <li>Final Fantasy 7: Cloud, Ex-Soldier</li>
            <li>Gimball</li>
            <li>Eowyn</li>
            <li>Rin and Seri, Inseperable</li>
            <li>Szarel</li>
            <li>Rick</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
